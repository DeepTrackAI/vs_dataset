## Overview

This DeepTrackAI repository replicates part of the **In Silico Labeling Dataset**, available from the [in-silico-labeling GitHub Repository](https://github.com/google/in-silico-labeling/blob/master/data.md) and described in [Christiansen et al, Cell, 2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2018.03.040).

These images were used for developing models that predict virtual staining of biological samples from brightfield images.

Out of the total dataset, this repository only contains the folders named `Rubin/scott_1_0` corresponding to the human motor neurons dataset, labeled as "Condition A" in the original dataset.  
This dataset comprises twenty-two pairs of brightfield images and their corresponding fluorescence images. Each pair includes spatially coregistered images (meaning that the brightfield and fluorescence images are matched pixel by pixel so that corresponding features appear in the same locations in both images), showcasing two fluorescent channels: Hoechst stain, which stains nuclei blue, and anti-TuJ1 stain, which stains neurons green. Notably, the brightfield images consist of a z-stack of thirteen images across different focal planes, offering a comprehensive view of the cellular structures.  
The filenames themselves include enough information to understand the contents of each image.

The dataset contains images corresponding to 25 fields of view, with 22 in the train folder and 3 in the test folder. For each field of view, a z-stack of 13 brightfield images, a fluorescence image, and the predicted fluorescence image are available.  
Each image is an RGB image with 8-bit per channel in PNG format. Brightfield images repeat the same information across all 3 channels.

- **Dataset Size**: 25 images (22 training + 3 test)
- **Image Size**: Various
- **Color**: RGB (brightfield)
- **Labels**: RGB (fluorescence)
